## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this repo [Indian-covid-tracker-Webapp](https://github.com/beharavenkatasatyaprasad/Indian-covid-tracker-Webapp).

Click [here](https://covid19-india-webapp.netlify.app/) to preview the app.
## The Webapp

This app is to integrate myself with the [Covid India API](https://api.covid19india.org) to pull data and display it.

I have used HTML,CSS & JavaScript on the front-end to develop this particular Webapp.

Users are able to:

- See all states data from the API on the homepage
- Search for a state using an `input` field
- Click on a state to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
